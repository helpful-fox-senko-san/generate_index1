This tool will try to generate a set of .index files from .index2 files.
This is only to allow for other tools to work with Dawntail benchmark files.
The generated .index files will almost certainly not work with the game.

It will also write ffxivgame.ver with a dummy value of "9999.05.00.0000.0001"

Run from the Dawntrail benchmark "game" directory.

ffxiv-explorer's hashlist.db can be provided with updated file paths, by deleting hashlist.cache
